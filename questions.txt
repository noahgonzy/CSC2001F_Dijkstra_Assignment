are we supposed to be running djikstras algorithm on each graph until it finds a path?

can we have some graphs that generate only 19 instead of 20 verticies for example?

am i counting the number of edge processes and vertex processes in the right place?

surely when using V=50 and E=20 like in the example, the program wouldn't see 50 vertexes? thus it's unusable data?
